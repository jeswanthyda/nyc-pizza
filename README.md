# 🍕 NYC-PIZZA-DELIVERY

You play as a pizza delivery driver racing against the clock to pick up pizzas from shops and deliver them to customers at their homes.

Your mission? Deliver as many pizzas as possible in **1min**.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nyc-pizza
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

### Running the Game

The NYC Pizza game consists of two components that need to be running:

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   make run_backend_server
   ```
   This will start the FastAPI server on `http://localhost:8000`

2. **In a new terminal, start the game:**
   ```bash
   make run_game
   ```

### Game Requirements

- **Backend must be running**: The game client requires the FastAPI backend server to be running for session management and score tracking
- **Two terminals needed**: One for the backend server, one for the game client
- **Default ports**: Backend runs on port 8000, game client connects to it

### Troubleshooting

- **"Connection refused" errors**: Make sure the backend server is running before starting the game
- **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `make install`
- **Python version**: Make sure you're using Python 3.13 or higher

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Architecture Overview 

- **Frontend**: Arcade package to build 2D ui/ux in python.
- **Backend**: FastAPI server sitting infrom of database to managing sessions, scores, and leaderboards  
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight, persistent storage
- **Communication**: RESTful API between FE and BE.

### UX/UI Design Decisions

- **1-minute gameplay loops** - Perfect for quick sessions and high replayability
- **Real-time visual feedback** - Flashing highlights show current pickup/delivery locations
- **Intuitive controls** - WASD/Arrow keys for movement, Space for actions
- **Clear scoring system** - +$10 per delivery, -$1 per subway use, with real-time sidebar updates
- **Manhattan grid layout** - Authentic NYC street system with numbered avenues and streets"

### Backend Design (30 seconds)

- **FastAPI** for high-performance async API endpoints
- **Pydantic models** for data validation and serialization
- **SQLite** with proper migrations for session storage
- **RESTful endpoints** for CRUD operations on game sessions
- **Leaderboard functionality** with top scores and player-specific best scores

The API supports session creation, updates, leaderboards, and player statistics.
